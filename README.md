# Introduction
For the Applied Project and Minor Dissertation module, the student participating may gain opportunity to gain experience at working on a project similar to one encountered in the software industry, in collaboration with academic supervisors and technical staff. The project will be on a topic selected from a list, or alternatively one proposed by the student subject to suitability and availability of resources. The project must deal with a task or problem deemed to be of sufficient technical challenge and depth. 

The student must complete their submission no later than the **10th April 2022**. 

The student must display evidence that the learning outcomes of the module have been realised. These learning outcomes include:

* Demonstrate the application of **appropriate research methodologies and techniques** related to software development.
* Demonstrate an awareness of the **present state of the art in a specialist computing area** including the ability to evaluate the literature base.
* Integrate disparate technologies and principles to **successfully develop and deliver an appropriately integrated solution** to a computer-based project.
* Apply **research and critical thinking skills** to a challenging computer-based problem.
* Evaluate, select and apply standard and customised **research tools and methodologies of enquiry**.
* Design and implement a computing solution that **requires preliminary research**.
* **Critically evaluate their work and research** and reflect on the strength, weaknesses and future potential of such work.
